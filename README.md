This project was conducted as a mid-semester exam for our Regression and Analysis course. In this project, we tried to predict the number of guests in a hotel using severall variables, such as the average stay duration, occupancy rate, total number of beds, total number of rooms, population density of the region, and the number of tourists in Indonesia. The model we used was the Multivariate Linear Regression model and we achieved an $$R^2%% of .969.

The data iteself was taken from Badan Pusat Statistik from the year 2016 and 2019.
